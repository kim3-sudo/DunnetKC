            You travel down the road, about only 100 metres and you encounter
            a giant spider with vicious poison coated fangs.
            its hideous appearance causes your throat to dry and your knees to shake!

            You viscously swing your sword at the spiders general direction.
            The swing was so great, your arms jolts out of place,
            creating a surge of pain.
            Your arm is now broken, and you fall to the ground in pain...
            The spider launches 3 metres straight into your body...
            What on earth is it doing?
            Oh My God! The spider is devouring everything...
            All that remained was bones of the once mobile adventurer.
